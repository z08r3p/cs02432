Project: Calibrating the BS model and Constructing a Hedging   Strategy
We have learned multiple models and formulas   for pricing options.   In   this project,   we   seek to explore the application of   pricing options in real life using multiple tools,   and   assess   the   accuracy   of   our method. We will also make a hedging strategy for the   options   using   delta.
We are going to choose a stock   and   collect   data   on the   stock   and   option   prices,   and   then   estimate   the price of   the options using our tools. In particular, the project involves   1) calibrating   the
Black-Scholes model   to get the implied volatility (sigma that minimizes the   SSE between the market   prices   of   the   options   and   the   price   generated   by   the   BS   model), 2)   estimating   the   prices   of   the options 代 写Calibrating the BS model and Constructing a Hedging StrategyMatlab

Our project will require the stock   price, call and put option prices,   and the time   to maturity.   We   will get most of   the data   from Yahoo Finance.
This project will be based on Lecture 3  4 (Week   3-4).   The   formulas   needed   might   include:
●         Black   Scholes formula
●         Sum of Squares for Error (SSE)
●       Delta under   Black   Scholes
General Methodology:
●         Data Collection
●         Model Calibration
●         Price Estimation
●         Strategy Construction
